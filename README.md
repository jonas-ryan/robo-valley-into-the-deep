This is a fork of the roadrunner repo. Roadrunner lets you tune the robot and then tell it to move to any position by tracking the rotation of odometry wheels. 

To send to program to the robot you need to:
1. Turn on the robot
2. Connect to the robot's wifi
3. Open rev hardware client and connect to the robot
4. Select that device in android studio
5. Run the program

To make a new OpMode, you can copy "OpModeTemplate.java" or any of the templates in "FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples". Then you can place the copy in "TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/robovalley". Make sure to remove "@Disabled" if you want it to show up on the driver hub.
